#!/usr/bin/env awk
#
# This app processes a Makefile and extracts targets and their descriptions.
# Targets a space seperaated list of names followed by a colon.
# A description is the trimed text following "## " on the same line.
#
# Example Makefile usage:
# ----------------------------------
# NOTE: Recipe lines below are written as "#<space><tab>cmd".
#       If you delete the leading "# ", the tab is preserved,
#       so you get a valid Makefile with proper tabs.

# ----------------------------------
#
# Rules:
# - Parse ONLY the file passed as argv[1] (typically $(lastword $(MAKEFILE_LIST))).
# - Basic form; list of targets, a colon then anything then "## " followed by description:
#       <targets> ":.*" "##" spaces <desc>
# - Recipe lines (start with a tab) are ignored.
# - Character set is UTF-8, case-sensitive. No multi-line target lists.
# - Ignore lines where desc begins with "@internal".
# - Render "name.%" as "name.<cmd>" in the targets column.
# - Acceptes two parameters:
#    - indent_pad=X   Where X is number of spaces to indent first column, default 4
#    - desc_pad=Y     Where Y is number of spaces between the widest targets column
#                     and the start of descriptor column, default 4
# - Order returned is the order processed.
